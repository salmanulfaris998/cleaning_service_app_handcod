Project Overview

This project is a Flutter cleaning service app connected with Supabase as the backend and Firebase for authentication.
It includes main features like Google login, phone OTP, service listings, add to cart, apply coupons, wallet balance, and order history.
All user data, orders, and wallet transactions are stored and managed in Supabase.
The app uses Riverpod for state management and follows a clean folder structure for better code organization.
